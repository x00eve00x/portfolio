            <h1 class="text-secondary">So, Basically...</h1>
            <p>
                My name is <strong>√àve Major</strong> and I'm from Montreal, Canada.
                <br/>
                I followed a sort of weird, unconventional path that led me to become a
                <span class="text-secondary important">web developer üíª</span>...
                <br />
                I studied <span class="text-secondary important">Visual Arts üé®</span> (DEC) at C√©gep du Vieux-Montreal,
                as well as taking <span class="text-secondary important">Mathematics</span> classes (just for the fun of
                it <span class="emojis">&#x1F92A;</span>).
                <br />
                Then, I  went to Universit√© de Montr√©al to study <span class="text-secondary important">Psychology &#x03A8;</span>.
                <br />
                Meanwhile, I gained interest in web development, and started learning how to code on
                my free times (and also during some of my psych classes <span class="emojis">ü§´</span>).
                <br />
                But throughout the years, I realised that, even though I had a great interest in (most) of my classes, I
                couldn't picture myself working in that field. That's when I decided to end my studies and devote myself
                to coding.<span class="emojis">&#x1F913;</span>
                <br />
                I was lucky enough to have resourceful and motivating people around me that guided me through
                that journey.<span class="emojis">üôè</span>
                <br />
                I self-learned the basics and then went deeper into this wide world that is web development...
                <br />
               <!-- I dived a bit in the backend but found myself having more fun working/playing with
                the  <span class="text-secondary important">frontend</span>. Because it deals with the visual and interactive side of websites, it leaves more room to
                <span class="text-secondary important">creativity</span>.
                <br />
                <br />
                <em class="text-secondary important">Im still learning constantly, and will always do.</em>-->

                <!--I have a creative mind but I also consider myself as an analytic thinker who enjoys solving problems.-->
